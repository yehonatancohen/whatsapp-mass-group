# whatsapp-mass-group
A couple of scripts to select hundreds of people to add to a group

TO RUN:
Copy the functions to whatsapp web's console (F12 and then select console on top)
after opening the "Add Participiant" window type in console addPeople({amount you want to choose divided by 30})
and then confirm the addition to the group

BE CARFUL!
Adding to many people in a short period of time will cause a ban from WhatsApp
I would recommand to start with 50 people at a time

TODO; 
Make it easy to use (using a button or something)
See how you can make adding the contacts easier
